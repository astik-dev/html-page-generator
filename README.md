- **Page generation:**
  
  After clicking the `Create` button, the application generates an HTML page with the specified file name and the content provided in the admin panel. The uploaded image is saved as `img.[file extension]` in a new folder inside the `img` directory, named the same as the HTML file. The page is styled using the `new-page.css` file.
